# ---

# ### **üî• Step 1: Create `my_app.py` & Basic Setup**
# We'll start simple and add features gradually.

# #### **üìå Ordinary Code (Easy to Understand)**
# ```python
# import streamlit as st

# # Title & basic introduction
# st.title("üöó Vehicle Data Explorer")
# st.write("Welcome to the Vehicle Data Explorer App! This app allows you to analyze vehicle listings.")

# # File uploader (for later use)
# uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload your dataset (CSV format)", type=["csv"])

# # Basic message
# st.write("üìå Upload a dataset to get started!")
# ```

# #### **üí° Smart Version (More Compact & Efficient)**
# ```python
# import streamlit as st

# st.title("üöó Vehicle Data Explorer")
# st.write("Upload a dataset to start exploring!")

# uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload CSV file", type=["csv"])
# ```

# ---

# ### **üéØ Next Steps**
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run this with `streamlit run my_app.py`  
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Confirm it's working, then we‚Äôll **add dataset processing & visualizations**  

# Let me know when you're ready, and we‚Äôll **move to Step 2!** üöÄ










# You're off to a great start in adapting a general Streamlit template to your dataset! Let's go through some necessary fixes and improvements while maintaining best practices.

# ---

# ### **Key Issues & Fixes:**
# 1. **Dropdown Selection Issues:**
#    - The `selected_year` variable is created, but it's not used to filter the dataset.
#    - The `selected_car` list is created, but it's also not applied to filter the dataset.

# 2. **Column Handling Issues:**
#    - `model_year.max()` is used incorrectly; this will return a **single value**, not the max per row.
#    - `price_per_mile.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan)` is missing `.inplace=True` or reassignment.

# 3. **Display Issues:**
#    - The sidebar selections should reflect on the displayed dataset.
#    - The `st.write('Select a the make you like below')` has a typo and isn't doing anything functional.

# ---

# ### **Improved Version of Your Code**
# ```python
# # Standard libraries
# import numpy as np  
# import pandas as pd  
# import streamlit as st
# import plotly.express as px  

# # Streamlit Configuration
# st.set_page_config(page_title="Used Cars Market", layout="wide")

# # Streamlit Title & Headers
# st.title("Used Cars Market Dashboard")
# st.header("Analyze the Market of Used Cars")
# st.write("Filter cars by year and make to explore trends.")

# # Load dataset
# df_vehicles = pd.read_csv('vehicles_us.csv', low_memory=False)

# # Convert data types
# df_vehicles = df_vehicles.astype({
#     'model_year': 'Int64', 
#     'cylinders': 'Int64', 
#     'odometer': 'Int64'
# })
# df_vehicles['is_4wd'] = df_vehicles['is_4wd'].fillna(0).astype(bool)   
# df_vehicles['date_posted'] = pd.to_datetime(df_vehicles['date_posted'])

# # Split 'model' column into 'make' and 'model'
# df_vehicles[['make', 'model']] = df_vehicles['model'].str.split(' ', n=1, expand=True)

# # Rename columns

#     'odometer': 'odometer_miles',
#     'date_posted': 'listing_date',
#     'is_4wd': 'has_4wd'
# }, inplace=True)

# # Fix 'car_age' Calculation (Ensuring correct subtraction per row)
# df_vehicles['car_age'] = 2024 - df_vehicles['model_year']

# # Fix 'price_per_mile' Calculation (Avoiding divide-by-zero errors)
# df_vehicles['price_per_mile'] = df_vehicles['price'] / df_vehicles['odometer_miles'].replace(0, np.nan)
# df_vehicles['price_per_mile'].replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan, inplace=True)

# # High Mileage Indicator
# df_vehicles['high_mileage'] = df_vehicles['odometer_miles'] > 150000

# # Sidebar - Filters
# st.sidebar.header('Filter Options')

# # Year Filter
# min_year = int(df_vehicles['model_year'].min())

# st.plotly_chart(fig_scatter, use_container_width=True)
# ```

# ---

# ### **Fixes & Improvements in This Version**
# ‚úÖ **Filters Now Work:**  
# - The year filter correctly applies a range instead of a single selection.  
# - The make filter dynamically updates results.  

# ‚úÖ **Calculation Fixes:**  
# - `car_age` now subtracts from the current year (2024).  
# - `price_per_mile` no longer breaks when `odometer_miles = 0`.  

# ‚úÖ **Better Visuals & Layout:**  
# - **Histogram:** Shows car price distribution.  
# - **Scatter Plot:** Compares price vs. mileage.  

# ‚úÖ **Better UI & UX:**  
# - Sidebar now dynamically filters the dataset.  
# - Table updates based on selection.  
# - Interactive Plotly charts make insights clearer.  

# ---

# ### **Next Steps**
# - Do you want more features like filtering by `cylinders` or `transmission`?  
# - Would you like to add **a checkbox toggle for 4WD cars**?  
# - Should we deploy this to **Render or Hugging Face Spaces** for live testing?  

# Let me know how you'd like to proceed! üöÄ


# You're absolutely right! Instead of just fixing the mistakes, let's go step by step so you can understand **why** each issue occurs and **how** to correct it yourself.  

# I'll guide you through **debugging** and **fixing** your own code. Let's go one issue at a time.  

# ---

# ## **Step 1: Debug Sidebar Selection Issues**
# ### **Problem:**  
# - You created `selected_year` and `selected_car`, but they **aren't applied** to filter the dataset.

# ### **Your Code:**
# ```python
# selected_year = st.sidebar.selectbox('Year', list(reversed(range(1950,2020))))
# selected_car = st.sidebar.multiselect('Make', unique_make, unique_make)
# ```
# ‚úÖ **What‚Äôs right?**  
# - `selectbox` for year and `multiselect` for make are **correct Streamlit UI elements**.  

# ‚ùå **What‚Äôs wrong?**  
# - These variables **aren‚Äôt used** in filtering `df_vehicles`.  

# ---

# ### **üîß Fix It Yourself:**
# 1. **Add a print statement to debug**  
#    - We need to **see** what values `selected_year` and `selected_car` hold.  
#    - Add this **below your sidebar selection code**:

#    ```python
#    st.write(f"Selected Year: {selected_year}")
#    st.write(f"Selected Makes: {selected_car}")
#    ```

# 2. **Manually check** what appears in your Streamlit app after selecting different values.  

# 3. **Apply the filter** using `.loc[]`:
#    - Try writing the correct filtering condition **yourself first**.  
#    - Your dataset has:
#      - `model_year` (for year selection)
#      - `make` (for car make selection)

# ---

# ### **‚è≥ Try It Now & Tell Me What You Get**
# After adding the `st.write()` debugging lines,  
# - What values do you see when selecting different years & makes?  
# - What happens when you try to filter the dataset manually?  

# Tell me what you find, and we'll fix it together. üöÄ



# Yes! Instead of showing **all makes** as pre-selected, we can improve the UI using:  

# 1. **Default to an empty selection** (so the user selects only what they need).  
# 2. **Use a dropdown with search capabilities** to make selection easier.  

# ---

# ## **üîß Fix It Yourself!**
# ### **Replace This (Your Code):**
# ```python
# selected_car = st.sidebar.multiselect('Make', unique_make, unique_make)
# ```
# ---
# ### **With This (Improved UI)**
# ```python
# selected_car = st.sidebar.multiselect(
#     'Select Car Make(s)',  # More descriptive label
#     unique_make,  # Options
#     default=None,  # No preselected cars (user selects what they need)
#     placeholder="Choose car makes..."  # A hint inside the dropdown
# )
# ```
# ---
# ### **Why Is This Better?**
# ‚úÖ **Cleaner UI:** No more pre-selected values cluttering the sidebar.  
# ‚úÖ **More User-Friendly:** The dropdown lets the user **search** for car makes.  
# ‚úÖ **Faster Selection:** Instead of removing makes, users just pick the ones they want.  

# ---
# ### **üîç Next Step (Try It!)**
# - Add this change to your code.  
# - Run the Streamlit app.  
# - Let me know if you like it or if you want more improvements! üöÄ



# Good catch! The issue is that `selected_year` is not a range but a **single value** (since `st.sidebar.selectbox` allows only one selection).  

# ---

# ## **üîß Fix It Yourself!**
# ### **Replace This (Your Code)**
# ```python
# filtered_df = df_vehicles[
#     (df_vehicles['model_year'].between(selected_year[0], selected_year[1])) &  
#     (df_vehicles['make'].isin(selected_makes))
# ]
# ```
# ---
# ### **With This (Corrected Code)**
# ```python
# filtered_df = df_vehicles[
#     (df_vehicles['model_year'] == selected_year) &  # Fix the filtering logic
#     (df_vehicles['make'].isin(selected_car))  # Fix the variable name
# ]
# ```
# ---
# ### **üîç Why This Fix?**
# ‚úÖ **`selected_year` is a single number** ‚Üí No need for `.between()`  
# ‚úÖ **Corrected `selected_car` variable name** ‚Üí Matches your sidebar selection  

# ---
# ### **üîç Next Step (Try It!)**
# - Apply this fix and test it in your Streamlit app.  
# - Check if filtering works correctly for both **year & make** selections.  
# - Let me know if you need another tweak! üöÄ




# Ah, the error message **"Lengths must match to compare"** indicates that `selected_year` is not being handled properly in the filtering logic. Since `st.sidebar.selectbox` is used for selecting only one value, `selected_year` is just a **single integer** and needs to be compared directly, not in an element-wise comparison like we are doing with a list or a range.

# ### The Issue
# - The error arises because `df_vehicles['model_year']` is a **Series** (a column of the dataframe) and `selected_year` is just a **single integer**.
# - You don't need to compare the entire column to the `selected_year` as if it's a list or range.

# ### The Fix

# To filter based on the `selected_year`, just compare the `model_year` column to the selected value directly. Here's how:

# ```python
# # Apply Filters
# filtered_df = df_vehicles[
#     (df_vehicles['model_year'] == selected_year) &  # Corrected filtering logic
#     (df_vehicles['make'].isin(selected_car))  # Corrected variable name
# ]
# ```

# ### Why Does This Work?
# - **Single integer comparison**: We're directly comparing `df_vehicles['model_year']` to a single integer (`selected_year`) which should work without any issues.
# - The other part (`selected_car`) stays the same because you're filtering based on the selected makes in the sidebar.

# ### Next Step
# - Replace that line in your code and test it again.  
# - Let me know if it works as expected, or if you run into any new challenges! üöÄ



# Thank you for clarifying! The issue lies in how the `selected_year` is being used in the filtering step. Since `st.sidebar.slider` returns a **tuple** (because of the range selection), it needs to be handled properly.

# ### What's Happening:
# - The `selected_year` from the slider is actually a tuple: `(min_year, max_year)`, not a single integer.
# - To filter the dataframe for a range of years, you need to use `between()` instead of checking for equality.

# ### The Fix:
# To filter based on the year range, we can use the `between()` function for the `model_year` column. This will work for filtering the data within the selected range. Here's the corrected code:

# ```python
# # Apply Filters
# filtered_df = df_vehicles[
#     (df_vehicles['model_year'].between(selected_year[0], selected_year[1])) &  # Filter between selected years
#     (df_vehicles['make'].isin(selected_car))  # Filter based on selected makes
# ]
# ```

# ### Explanation:
# - **`selected_year[0]`**: This is the **start** of the range (`min_year`).
# - **`selected_year[1]`**: This is the **end** of the range (`max_year`).
# - **`between()`**: It allows you to filter rows where `model_year` is between `selected_year[0]` and `selected_year[1]`.

# ### Key Points:
# - The `slider` returns a **tuple**, and we need to unpack that tuple to filter based on the range.
# - `between()` is ideal for filtering a range of values.

# ### Try This and Let Me Know:
# Replace the filtering code with this version and test it again. Let me know how it works!
