# Streamlit Vehicle Data Dashboard
# Project Description:

This Streamlit application is designed to visualize and analyze vehicle dataset information. Users can filter, compare, and explore various aspects of vehicle listings, including price, mileage, and age distributions. The dashboard includes interactive charts and visualizations powered by Plotly

# Features
-  Load and display vehicle dataset in a structured format.
-  Interactive filtering based on year, make, and model.
-  Side-by-side vehicle comparison tool.
-  Dynamic charts including histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
-  Correlation heatmap for numerical features.

# Technologies Used
-  Python for data processing and application logic.
-  Streamlit for interactive web application development.
-  Pandas for data manipulation.
-  Plotly Express for visualizations.
-  Render for online deployment.

# Instructions on how to run the app locally using the my_app.py file.
- To run the project locally, you need to:
    * clone the repository using: git clone https://github.com/drssam/new_app.git
    * create a python environment: python -m venv xxxx
    * install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
    * run Streamlit: streamlit run my_app.py

# A link to the deployed web app.
- To deploy this project on Render:
    * u need the file: requirements.txt
    * push and update your github: git add .
                                    git commit -m "Updated project files"
                                    git push origin main
    * if render fails, try creating a Procfile


# Notes to the Reviewer: 
    - Switching off warnings (optional): I imported the warning library, and added the additional code line. I also cleared the cache and redeployed my app. However, I didn't check the final results.
    - Car Comparison (Optional): I am 3-4 weeks behind because of an issue with anaconda and jupyter installation. since the car comparison is optional, I decided not to spend more time fixing it. 
        I hope you understand. 
            -> Thank you
    - The app can clearly be developed more effectively, and we can add more creative widgets, and I hope, I will be able to find the appropriate time to develop it further. 

    Thank you
